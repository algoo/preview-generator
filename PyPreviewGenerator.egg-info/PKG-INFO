        This module allows to generate jpeg, pdf, text or html preview for virtually any kind of files including a cache management.
        It allows to generate preview for a given page and put it in cache. The context of creation of this module (as an example of use context) was for **Tracim**, a github project (https://github.com/Tracim/tracim) where users can put file on a
        repository in order to share it with other users. The only way to find a file was with his name. Hence it was decided to generate previews of the files in order to ease the location of one. **Only works on Linux**.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        `pip install PyPreviewGenerator`
        
        
        -----------
        Requirement
        -----------
        
        This package uses several libraries :
        
          - wand
          - python-magick
          - pillow
          - PyPDF2
        
        These should be automatically installed with the `pip install PyPreviewGenerator` command. But if some error occurs quoting one of these library, try to manually install them with a simple `pip install ...`
        
        **WARNING!** about **LibreOffice**
        
        If you want to use the conversion from an office file to pdf or jpeg, ensure that **LibreOffice** is already installed on the computer because the conversion is made by the Libreoffice's export feature.

        Usage

        Getting a preview
        -----------------
        
        .. code:: python
        
          from PyPreviewGenerator.manager import PreviewManager
          manager = PreviewManager(path='/home/user/Pictures/')
          path_to_file = manager.get_jpeg_preview(
            file_path='/home/user/Pictures/myfile.gif',
            height=100,
            width=100,
          )
          print('Preview created at path : ', path_to_file)
        
        
        
        
        The preview manager
        -------------------
        
        .. code:: python
        
          preview_manager = PreviewManager(cache_path)
        
        *args :*
        
           *cache_path : a String of the path to the directory where the cache file will be stored*
        
        *returns :*
        
          *a PreviewManager Object*
        
        The builders
        ------------
        
        Here is the way it is meant to be used
        
        For Office types into PDF :
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
          preview_manager = PreviewManager(cache_path)
          preview = preview_manager.get_pdf_preview(file_path,page=page_id)
        
        -> Will create a preview from an office file into a pdf file
        
        *args :*
        
          *file_path : the String of the path where is the file you want to get the preview*
        
          *page : the page you want to get. If not mentioned all the pages will be returned*
        
        *returns :*
        
          *a FileIO stream of bytes of the pdf preview*
        
        For images(GIF, BMP, PNG, JPEG, PDF) into jpeg :
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: python
        
          preview_manager = PreviewManager(cache_path)
          preview = preview_manager.get_jpeg_preview(file_path,height=1024,width=526)
        
        -> Will create a preview from an image file into a jpeg file of size 1024 * 526
        
        *args :*
        
          *file_path : the String of the path where is the file you want to get the preview*
        
          *height : height of the preview in pixels*
        
          *width : width of the preview in pixels. If not mentioned, width will be the same as height*
        
        *returns :*
        
          *a FileIO stream of bytes of the jpeg preview*
        
        Other conversions :
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The principle is the same as above
        
        **Zip to text or html :** will build a list of files into texte/html inside the json
        
        **Office to jpeg :** will build the pdf out of the office file and then build the jpeg.
        
        **Text to text :** mainly just a copy stored in the cache
