        This module is meant to be used inside applications to generate the
        preview of a document. The context of creation of this module (as an
        example of use context) was for Tracim, a github project
        (https://github.com/Tracim/tracim) where users can put file on a
        repository in order to share it with other users. The only way to find a
        file was with his name. Hence it was decided to generate previews of the
        files in order to ease the location of one.
